A super simple Discord bot to preserve a users roles when they leave the server and rejoin.

No selfhosting support for this bot will be provided - if you are skilled enough, you can figure out how to run icu 
easily yourself.

"icu" is a play on the phrase "I see you", as the main reason this bot came into existence is to prevent users from 
avoiding moderation roles like "muted" or "warned" or similar ones.
